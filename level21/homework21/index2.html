        some freaquently asked questions about peruvian guinea pigs:
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            How long do Peruvian guinea pigs live?
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The lifespan of a Peruvian guinea pig varies, but typically they can 
                <u>live anywhere from 4 years up to the ripe old age of 6.</u>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>
            Do Peruvian guinea pigs need haircuts?
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Yes! With hair that is constantly growing, Peruvian coats can get very long (typically anywhere up to 10-14 inches). While you don't need to be a qualified barber, you will need some basic tools to give your pig a regular trim.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>
            Do Peruvian guinea pigs have health issues
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                To reduce the risk of long-term health problems, make sure your Peruvian cavy receives the same care required of all breeds:<u>high-quality pellets, plentiful fresh hay, and some tasty snacks loaded with Vitamin C. On top of this, to benefit their silky locks, you'll want to ensure they consume enough Omega-3 fatty acids.
                </u>
